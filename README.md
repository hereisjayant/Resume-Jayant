## Technical Skills

## Programming Languages: C, C++, Java, HTML, Verilog, Assembly: x86-64, ARM

## Framework and Tools: SolidWorks, MATLAB, Raspberry Pi, Android Studio, Arduino MCU

```
Git, Linux/UNIX, Windows, IntelliJ, ModelSim, Quartus
```
## Technical Projects

## Interrupt Supported RISC Machine (Sep-Dec 2019) (UBC)

```
Verilog, Assembly: x86-64, ARM,
DE1-SoC, ModelSim & Quartus
```
- DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 16-BIT INSTRUCTION SUPPORTED CPU ON THE FPGA BOARD DE1-SOC USING
VERILOG, QUARTUS, AND MODELSIM. • I/O INTERRUPT SIGNALS VIA EXTERNAL KEYS AND SWITCHES WOULD CAUSE
THE STATE MACHINE TO FINISH THE CURRENT INSTRUCTION, SAVE THE CONTENTS OF ITS REGISTERS, FLAGS AND
PROGRAM COUNTER, RETRIEVE THE ADDRESS OF THE INTERRUPT SERVICE ROUTINE FROM A PREDEFINED LOCATION
IN MEMORY, AND UPDATE THE PROGRAM COUNTER WITH THE ADDRESS.

## A Virtual Memory and Multi-process supported OS (Sep-Dec 2019) (UBC)

ARM assembly, Intel FPGA Monitor
Program, FPGA board DE1-SOC
DESIGNED AN OPERATING SYSTEM THAT SUPPORTS TWO CONCURRENT PROCESSES USING ARM ASSEMBLY, INTEL
FPGA MONITOR PROGRAM, AND THE FPGA BOARD DE1-SOC. EACH PROCESS HAS ITS OWN VIRTUAL MEMORY SPACE
(ISOLATED FROM EACH OTHER) AND TWO-LEVEL PAGE-TABLES ARE SUPPORTED.

## Network Ad Blocker (Jun-Jul 2019) (Personal Project) Raspberry Pi

A DEVICE THAT WOULD BLOCK ADS ON MY WI-FI NETWORK, BY INSTALLING PI-HOLE ON A RASPBERRY-PI, THEN
CHANGING MY ROUTER’S DNS/DHCP SETTINGS AND USING THE PI-HOLE AS THE ONLY DNS SERVER, THEREBY
ROUTING THE NETWORK TRAFFIC THROUGH THE RASPBERRY-PI WHICH WILL INTERCEPT AND DENY THE ACCESS TO
AD-SERVING DOMAINS, THEREBY PREVENTING ADS FROM BEING DOWNLOADED.

## Catapult Project (2017) Arduino, Spreadsheets

DESIGNED A CATAPULT WHICH MEASURES THE ANGULAR VELOCITY OF THE THROWING ARM TO PREDICT THE
PROJECTILE.
