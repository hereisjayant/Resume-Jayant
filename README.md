## Technical Skills
### Programming Languages
```
C, C++, Java, HTML, Markdown, Verilog, Assembly: x86-64, ARM
```
### Framework and Tools

```
SolidWorks, MATLAB, Raspberry Pi, Android Studio, Arduino MCU, Git, Linux/UNIX, Windows, IntelliJ, ModelSim, Quartus
```
## Technical Projects

### Mediator Service and Server for Wikipedia (Sep-Dec 2020) (UBC)
```
Java, FSFT Buffer, ANTLR, JSON, JWiki API, IntelliJ
```
IMPLEMENTED AN FSFT(FINITE SPACE FINITE TIME) BUFFER THAT CAN HANDLE MULTIPLE THREADS TO BE USED AS
DATA-CACHE. CREATE A MEDIATOR SERVICE FOR WIKIPEDIA USING THE JWIKI API THAT OBTAINS PAGES AND OTHER
RELEVANT INFORMATION. THE MEDIATOR SERVICE SUPPORTS STRUCTURED QUERIES WHICH USE ANTLR FOR
PARSER GENERATION. FSFT BUFFER WAS USED TO CACHE THE WIKIPEDIA PAGES TO MINIMIZE NETWORK ACCESSES.
ALSO IMPLEMENTED A SERVER APPLICATION THAT WRAPS THE MEDIATOR SERVICE CAPABLE OF PROCESSING
MULTIPLE CLIENT REQUESTS SIMULTANEOUSLY, USING JSON TO EXCHANGE INFORMATION.

### Image Processing and Computer Vision Project (Sep-Dec 2020) (UBC)
```
Java, Image processing, Computer Vision, DFT, IntelliJ
```
IMPLEMENTED A DATATYPE USING CORE LIBRARIES IN JAVA THAT ALLOWS YOU TO PERFORM VARIOUS IMAGE
PROCESSING AND COMPUTER VISION OPERATIONS ON AN IMAGE. THIS INVOLVED IMPLEMENTING AND
DOCUMENTING OPERATIONS LIKE MIRRORING, CLIPPING, DE-NOISING, ROTATION USING NEAREST NEIGHBOUR
INTERPOLATION, COMPARISON OF IMAGES USING COSINE SIMILARITY, CALCULATING THE DFT OF THE IMAGES.
ADVANCED OPERATIONS LIKE GREEN-SCREENING AND ALGORITHMS TO ALIGN TEXT OF SKEWED SCANNED
DOCUMENTS USING DFT WERE ALSO IMPLEMENTED WITH TESTS HAVING 100% CLASS COVERAGE.

### Analysing Social Networks (Sep-Dec 2019) (UBC)
```
Java, Adjacency List, Adjacency Matrix, BFS, DFS, Graphs, IntelliJ
```
IMPLEMENTED GRAPH USING ADJACENCY LIST AND ADJACENCY MATRIX. IMPLEMENTED GRAPH ALGORITHMS LIKE
BREADTH FIRST SEARCH (BFS), DEPTH FIRST SEARCH (DFS), CALCULATING COMMON UPSTREAM/DOWNSTREAM
VERTICES, DISTANCE AND GRAPH DIAMETER. USED THESE ALGORITHMS TO ANALYSE AN ANONYMIZED DATASET FROM
TWITTER TO GET THE COMMON FOLLOWERS OF TWO USERS, AND THE MINIMUM NUMBER OF RETWEETS NEEDED TO
GET USER A‚ÄôS TWEET APPEARS IN USER B‚ÄôS FEED.

### Interrupt Supported RISC Machine (Sep-Dec 2019) (UBC)
```
Verilog, Assembly: x86-64, ARM, DE1-SoC, ModelSim & Quartus
```
- DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 16-BIT INSTRUCTION SUPPORTED CPU ON THE FPGA BOARD DE1-SOC USING
VERILOG, QUARTUS, AND MODELSIM.
‚Ä¢ I/O INTERRUPT SIGNALS VIA EXTERNAL KEYS AND SWITCHES WOULD CAUSE
THE STATE MACHINE TO FINISH THE CURRENT INSTRUCTION, SAVE THE CONTENTS OF ITS REGISTERS, FLAGS AND
PROGRAM COUNTER, RETRIEVE THE ADDRESS OF THE INTERRUPT SERVICE ROUTINE FROM A PREDEFINED LOCATION
IN MEMORY, AND UPDATE THE PROGRAM COUNTER WITH THE ADDRESS.

### A Virtual Memory and Multi-process supported OS (Sep-Dec 2019) (UBC)
```
ARM assembly, Intel FPGA Monitor Program, FPGA board DE1-SOC
```
DESIGNED AN OPERATING SYSTEM THAT SUPPORTS TWO CONCURRENT PROCESSES USING ARM ASSEMBLY, INTEL
FPGA MONITOR PROGRAM, AND THE FPGA BOARD DE1-SOC. EACH PROCESS HAS ITS OWN VIRTUAL MEMORY SPACE
(ISOLATED FROM EACH OTHER) AND TWO-LEVEL PAGE-TABLES ARE SUPPORTED.

### Network Ad Blocker (Jun-Jul 2019) (Personal Project) Raspberry Pi

A DEVICE THAT WOULD BLOCK ADS ON MY WI-FI NETWORK, BY INSTALLING PI-HOLE ON A RASPBERRY-PI, THEN
CHANGING MY ROUTER‚ÄôS DNS/DHCP SETTINGS AND USING THE PI-HOLE AS THE ONLY DNS SERVER, THEREBY
ROUTING THE NETWORK TRAFFIC THROUGH THE RASPBERRY-PI WHICH WILL INTERCEPT AND DENY THE ACCESS TO
AD-SERVING DOMAINS, THEREBY PREVENTING ADS FROM BEING DOWNLOADED.

### Catapult Project (2017) Arduino, Spreadsheets

DESIGNED A CATAPULT WHICH MEASURES THE ANGULAR VELOCITY OF THE THROWING ARM TO PREDICT THE
PROJECTILE.
