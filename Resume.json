Create a mediator service for Wikipedia using the JWiki API that obtains pages and other relevant information. The mediator service supports structured queries which use ANTLR for parser generation. FSFT buffer was used to cache the Wikipedia pages to minimize network accesses. Also implemented a server application that wraps the mediator service capable of processing multiple client requests simultaneously, using JSON to exchange information.",

This involved implementing and documenting operations like mirroring, clipping, de-noising, rotation using nearest neighbour interpolation, comparison of images using cosine similarity, calculating the DFT of the images. Advanced operations like green-screening and algorithms to align text of skewed scanned documents using DFT were also implemented with tests having 100% class coverage.",
